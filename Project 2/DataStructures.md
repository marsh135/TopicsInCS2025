Python Data Structures Practice

These exercises will help you practice using the four main Python data structures: lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

⸻

Part 1: Lists
	1.	Create a list of 10 numbers.
	2.	Print the first, last, and middle number.
	3.	Add a new number to the end of the list.
	4.	Replace the third number with 99.
	5.	Loop through the list and print only the even numbers.

Extension: Ask the user for 5 numbers, store them in a list, and print the list in reverse.

⸻

Part 2: Dictionaries
	1.	Create a dictionary of 5 countries and their capitals.
	2.	Print the capital of 2 countries.
	3.	Add a new country-capital pair.
	4.	Change the capital of one country.
	5.	Loop through and print all countries and capitals.

Extension: Ask the user for a country name and print the capital, or "Not found" if the country is not in the dictionary.

⸻

Part 3: Sets
	1.	Create a set of your favorite fruits.
	2.	Add a new fruit, then remove one.
	3.	Create another set of fruits your friend likes.
	4.	Print:
	•	Fruits you both like (intersection).
	•	Fruits only you like (difference).
	•	All fruits either of you like (union).

Extension: Ask the user to enter a fruit and check if it’s in your set.

Part 4: Tuples
	1.	Create a tuple of 5 colors.
	2.	Print the first and last color.
	3.	Loop through the tuple and print each color.
	4.	Try to change one color (note the error).

Extension: Store (x, y) coordinates in a tuple and print them in the format:

Point is at x=___, y=___
